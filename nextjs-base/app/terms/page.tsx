          Welcome to Bleaum! This Merchant Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you ("Merchant," "you," or "your") and Bleaum, Inc., a Florida corporation headquartered in Miami, Florida ("Bleaum," "we," "us," or "our"), that governs your use of our software, services, hardware, and any other tools we provide. By signing an Order Form or accessing our Services, you're agreeing to the terms in this Agreement. Please read it carefully.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. Services</h2>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1.1 Access to Services</h3>
        <p>During your subscription term, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the Services you've purchased, as outlined in your Order Form.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1.2 Setup & Support</h3>
        <p>If you've purchased onboarding or support services, we'll work with you to implement everything smoothly. You agree to provide us with any info or access we need to help you.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1.3 Hardware</h3>
        <p>If you purchase hardware from Bleaum, our hardware warranty, return policy, and any specific terms outlined in your Order Form apply.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1.4 Users</h3>
        <p>You're responsible for anyone you allow to use Bleaum tools under your account. That includes keeping logins secure, ensuring your team follows the rules, and letting us know right away if there's any unauthorized access.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1.5 Evolving Products</h3>
        <p>We regularly update our platform to improve your experience. This may include adding, modifying, or removing features as needed.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1.6 Additional Terms</h3>
        <p>Some services may come with specific add-on terms. If you use a service that includes such conditions, they apply only to that service.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. Use Restrictions & Responsibilities</h2>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2.1 Use It Right</h3>
        <p>You agree to use our platform legally and ethically. You can't:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
          <li>Try to reverse-engineer or hack our software</li>
          <li>Copy or create competing products</li>
          <li>Resell, rent, or license our software to others</li>
          <li>Interfere with our platform's operations</li>
          <li>Use our platform for fraud or anything shady</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2.2 Compliance</h3>
        <p>If you're in a regulated industry (e.g., cannabis), you must keep all relevant licenses up to date. If your legal ability to operate changes, you must notify us and stop using the service. We may request documentation to confirm compliance and may suspend your account if that's not provided.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>You may integrate third-party tools with Bleaum. If you do, you authorize us to share data as necessary to enable that connection. Any use of third-party platforms is at your own risk and governed by their terms—not ours. We're not responsible for issues caused by third-party providers.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. Term & Termination</h2>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4.1 Agreement Term</h3>
        <p>This Agreement starts on your Effective Date and remains in effect unless terminated as outlined below.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4.2 Renewals</h3>
        <p>Your subscription renews automatically based on the term in your Order Form unless you give us 30 days' notice before the end of the current period.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4.3 Suspension</h3>
        <p>We may suspend your account if:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
          <li>You violate laws or this Agreement</li>
          <li>You miss a payment and don't fix it within 7 days of notice</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We won't suspend if you're actively and fairly disputing a charge.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4.4 Termination</h3>
        <p>Either party can terminate this Agreement if:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
          <li>The other party doesn't fix a material breach within 30 days of written notice</li>
          <li>The other party goes out of business or files for bankruptcy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may also terminate without cause by giving written notice.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4.5 Post-Termination</h3>
        <p>When this Agreement ends:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
          <li>Your access to the platform ends</li>
          <li>We may delete your data unless otherwise required by law</li>
          <li>If we end the agreement for convenience or you end it for cause, you'll get a refund for any unused, prepaid fees</li>
          <li>If you terminate without cause or we terminate for cause, you'll owe all remaining fees for the current term</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4.6 Survival</h3>
        <p>Sections like payment, confidentiality, intellectual property, warranties, limitations of liability, and others that logically should survive termination will survive.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. Fees & Payments</h2>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5.1 Pricing</h3>
        <p>You agree to pay the fees listed in your Order Form. Fees are due whether or not you actively use the platform, unless otherwise stated. All payments are non-refundable unless we've clearly said otherwise. If you dispute a charge, you must notify us within 20 days.</p>
        <p>We may charge interest (1.5% per month or the highest allowed by law) on overdue, undisputed amounts. Prices stay fixed during your initial term, but we may update fees for renewals with at least 30 days' notice.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5.2 Taxes</h3>
        <p>You're responsible for paying any sales, VAT, or other applicable taxes. If you're tax-exempt, provide us with valid documentation. If you're international and required to withhold taxes, you'll gross up payments so we receive the full amount due.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5.3 Automatic Payments</h3>
        <p>If you signed up for automatic billing, you authorize us to charge your card or bank account for fees due. You must keep your payment method updated. We use third-party processors, and your payment info may be shared securely with them.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5.4 Manual Billing</h3>
        <p>If you're invoiced manually, payment is due within 30 days unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">6. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6.1 Our IP</h3>
        <p>All rights to the Bleaum platform and any materials we provide are ours or our licensors'. If you give us feedback, we can use it freely to improve our products.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6.2 Your Data</h3>
        <p>You own all your business data. You grant us the right to use it only as needed to run and improve our platform. You must ensure you have the legal rights and customer consent to share that data with us.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6.3 Usage Data</h3>
        <p>We may aggregate and anonymize your data to help improve the platform, run analytics, or create industry insights. We own these anonymized results and may use them freely.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">7. Confidentiality</h2>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7.1 Mutual Protection</h3>
        <p>Both parties agree to keep each other's confidential information safe, using at least a reasonable standard of care. We won't share your info outside of what's necessary to provide our services, and you agree to do the same.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">8. Miscellaneous</h2>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">10. Limitation of Liability</h2>

        <p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will either party, its affiliates, or its or their service providers be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages, or loss of profits, revenue, data, or business opportunities arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Services, whether an action is in contract, tort, or otherwise, and regardless of the theory of liability.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">10.2 Limitation of Liability</h3>

Changes will take effect on the next business day after posting unless required for legal reasons or new features, in which case they may take effect immediately. If you disagree with a modification, you must notify Bleaum via email to comms@bleaum.io within 14 days. Your subscription will remain under the existing terms until the end of your then-current Subscription Term, after which the updated terms will apply.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">11.2 Governing Law; Jurisdiction</h3>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">11.8 Export Compliance</h3>
